### Hi there!
I’m Kamilа, a 21-year-old aspiring programmer with a passion for IT, history, and travel. Currently, I’m sharpening my skills in software development and exploring the endless possibilities of coding.

As an aesthete, I believe that design and usability go hand in hand, and I strive to make my work not only efficient but also visually inspiring.

In my free time, you’ll find me diving into new technologies, planning trips, or decorating for my favorite season—winter ❄️✨. I’m also a huge fan of cats 🐾 and love creating things that make life more fun and convenient.

Let’s connect and build something amazing together.
